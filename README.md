# Application use
The use of the application is for allowing users of the app to compete, or randomly select, for a location that they want to go to. Up to 10 players can participate, and a minimum of 2 players in various selections such as TicTacToe, Dice game that rolls until one player reaches 100, guessing the number game, and connect 4. Through using this application a winner is generated and that player gets their location that they provided chosen. 
# Shortcomings
To delete a player that has already been created, the shape must be clicked near its border, and not the initial that shows the players shortned name. Otherwise the button will appear as if it's not working when in actuality it does. 
# Cloning 
Fork the repository and import the project into Eclipse to run. Data, sounds, and image paths need to be reconfigured to users paths
